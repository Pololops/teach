## ✨ Why Teach?

Learning a new language shouldn't feel like studying. It should feel like **having a conversation**.

Teach transforms English learning for French speakers by creating an experience that's as natural as texting a friend — except this friend is an AI tutor that:

- 🎯 **Adapts to Your Level** — Automatically adjusts difficulty from beginner (A1) to advanced (C2)
- ⚡ **Responds Instantly** — Sub-2-second responses that maintain natural conversation flow
- 💬 **Feels Human** — No robotic scripts, just genuine, contextual conversations
- 🔒 **Protects Your Privacy** — Everything stays in your browser. No accounts, no tracking
- 📊 **Tracks Your Growth** — Watch your vocabulary expand and proficiency improve over time
- 🎨 **Looks Beautiful** — A clean, intuitive interface that makes you want to practice daily

## 🚀 Experience It Yourself

### The Magic in Action

**1. Start Chatting Immediately**  
No sign-up. No configuration. Just open the app and start typing in English.

**2. Real-Time Intelligence**  
Every message you send helps Teach understand your level. Within minutes, conversations adapt to challenge you perfectly — not too easy, not too hard.

**3. Learn As You Go**  
Inline corrections appear subtly in your messages. Hover to learn, or ignore them and keep the conversation flowing. Your choice.

**4. See Your Progress**  
Open your dashboard to see how many words you've learned, how long you've practiced, and how your English level has improved.

## 🎮 How It Works

### For Learners

1. **Open & Chat** — Start typing in English. The AI asks what you'd like to talk about.
2. **Stay Immersed** — All responses are in English, with gentle encouragement if you switch to French.
3. **Get Corrections** — See your mistakes highlighted inline. Click for explanations.
4. **Track Progress** — View your vocabulary growth, conversation time, and level progression.

## 🚦 Getting Started (Development)

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Linting
pnpm lint

# Build for production
pnpm build
```

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Create feature module**: `apps/frontend/src/features/my-feature/`
2. **Structure it properly**:

   ```text
   my-feature/
   ├── components/       # UI components
   ├── hooks/            # React hooks
   ├── services/         # Business logic
   ├── types/            # TypeScript types
   └── index.ts          # Public API exports
   ```

3. **Follow the rules**:
   - Max 7 props per component
   - Max 50 lines per function
   - Max 300 lines per file
   - TypeScript strict mode

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests** (Vitest) — Pure logic, algorithms (CEFR detection, corrections)
- **Integration Tests** — Feature interactions
- **E2E Tests** (Playwright) — Critical user journeys
- **Accessibility Tests** (axe-core) — WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance Tests** — Bundle size, load time, Core Web Vitals
